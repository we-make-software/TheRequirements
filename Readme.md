# **TheRequirements**  

The **#Requirements** system is structured **layer by layer**. We set a **start time** when the **#Requirements** is initialized and an **#end time** when it finishes.  

This is the same as **#Linux #Kernel** programmingâ€”when we load the `.ko` file into the kernel, everything follows the **rules defined by the programmer**.  

As a **#CProgramming** developer, the **best insight** is knowing **when a task started** and **when it ended** on a given server during **#testing** and **#development**.  

Since everything is structured in **layers**, why not start with a **setup layer**? The **`Layer0Setup`** macro does this automatically, helping developers **log and analyze execution times** in **#EmbeddedSystems** and **#SystemsProgramming**.  

Automation of the logging process helps **determine if the code is efficient** or if it needs improvements.  
- **How long did a task take?** (**#PerformanceTesting**)  
- **Compare different optionsâ€”do we need to optimize certain devices?**  
- **Should we focus on the fastest device?**  
- **Can someone else bring a better design for a required setup?**  

To **follow global best practices**, the system must be **well-structured and function perfectly** in **#SoftwareEngineering**.
